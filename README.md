# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A basic Rock Paper Scissors game coded in Python

When the user clicks a button (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), the program generates a random choice for the computer, compares it with the user's choice, and displays the outcome on the GUI along with updating the scores. The user can play the game by clicking the corresponding buttons, and the computer's choice is determined randomly.


P.S. - This was my first project in Python, so please excuse any shortcomings in my code :)
